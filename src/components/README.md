# Piano Tuning Helper

## Running
_assumes you have an android emulator ready to go_
```bash
$ npm run start
$ npm run android
```

i assume that you can run `$ npm run ios` for iPhone, but i haven't tried yet

## Roadmap
- [ ] draw piano
- [ ] highlight pressed key + display key name 
- [ ] model tuning steps + display them 
- [ ] build navigation 
- [ ] model reference intervals + display them 
- [ ] play reference clicks for each interval to illustrate the beat tempo to listen for 
- [ ] play reference sine waves to help identify the partials to tune against 

once everything is working, test cross-platform-ness + get working on web too
